Parser:
For while the main string is getting characters, the substring will update.
If the main string length is got, the parser will stop, and the words string will be ended, and finished properly.
If there are still more characters in the substring, the function will return an error (Flag) signalizing that.
If the sub main string length find it's end, and theres still charactera in the main string, the function will return an error (flag)

The parser will receive a string, with the words that should be skipped.

The parser will return only the flag, being the word list edited in the parameters.
